## 🌟 Core Features

This project offers a complete, end-to-end experience for both educators and students with dedicated dashboards and a powerful set of features.

### 🧑‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard
The central hub for managing all aspects of attendance tracking.

*   **Classroom Management**: Easily create, rename, and delete classrooms.
*   **Student Roster Management**: Add new students with their photo, full name, Library ID, and a unique password. View, edit, or remove students from the roster at any time.
*   **AI-Powered Attendance**: Simply upload a single photo of the classroom. The Gemini AI model analyzes the image against the student roster and instantly generates a detailed attendance report.
*   **Comprehensive Reports**: View a clear summary of who is present and absent. The system displays the original classroom photo with bounding boxes overlaid on detected faces, color-coded for present and unknown individuals.
*   **Interactive Corrections**:
    *   Manually toggle a student's status between 'Present' and 'Absent' if a correction is needed.
    *   For faces marked as 'Unknown', click on the bounding box to get an AI-powered suggestion identifying the most likely absent student. Confirm the suggestion with one click to update the report.
*   **AI Engagement Summary**: Receive a qualitative, one-paragraph summary of the classroom's atmosphere, mood, and engagement level, generated by the AI.
*   **Report History**: Access all past attendance reports for a selected classroom.
*   **Data Export**: Download any attendance report as a CSV file for your records.

### 🧑‍🎓 Student Dashboard
A secure and simple portal for students to track their own attendance.

*   **Secure Login**: Students log in using their unique Library ID and password set by the teacher.
*   **Personal Attendance History**: View a clean, chronological list of all recorded attendance sessions, clearly marked as 'Present' or 'Absent'.
*   **Profile View**: See their profile picture, name, and Library ID.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for a robust and type-safe user interface.
*   **Styling**: Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive, and utility-first design.
*   **AI & Facial Recognition**: Powered by the **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-2.5-pro`), which handles the complex multimodal task of analyzing images against a roster and returning structured JSON data.
*   **Data Persistence**: Utilizes the browser's **`localStorage`** and **`sessionStorage`** to create a complete, serverless experience, persisting classroom and report data on the user's device.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The magic of this application lies in its innovative use of the Gemini API's multimodal and function-calling capabilities.

1.  **Setup**: A teacher creates a classroom and populates the student roster, uploading a clear reference photo for each student.
2.  **Capture**: To take attendance, the teacher uploads a single photo of the classroom.
3.  **API Request**: The application sends the classroom photo along with the entire student roster (images and names) in a single, multimodal request to the Gemini API.
4.  **AI Analysis**: Gemini meticulously analyzes the classroom image, comparing each detected face against the student roster photos. It is instructed to only declare a match with very high confidence to ensure accuracy.
5.  **Structured Response**: The API returns a clean, structured JSON object containing:
    *   A list of `present` students with their names and bounding box coordinates.
    *   A list of `absent` students.
    *   A list of `unknown` faces with their bounding box coordinates.
    *   A qualitative `engagementSummary`.
6.  **Report Generation**: The frontend parses this JSON data to render the rich, interactive, and easy-to-understand attendance report on the teacher's dashboard.
